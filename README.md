## Getting Started

In order to build our front end assets, you need to have Node.js/npm latest and git 1.7 or later.
(Earlier versions might work OK, but are not tested.)

For Windows you have to download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Mac OS users should install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.

## Getting Started
First, clone a copy of this git repo by running:

```bash
git clone -b grunt git@github.com:jpdevries/stackerForm.git
```

Then cd into the `stackerForm` folder and install the Node&nbsp;dependencies:
```bash
cd stackerForm
npm install
```

You should now be able to run the Node&nbsp;server!
```bash
npm run start
```
